00:00:11,130 -----> 00:00:19,820
I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota
2
00:00:19,820 -----> 00:00:25,950
Many of you may have heard of the Lakota or at least the larger group of tribes called the Sioux
3
00:00:25,980 -----> 00:00:32,770
The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations
4
00:00:32,800 -----> 00:00:41,040
The Pine Ridge Reservation the subject of today's slide show is located about seventy five miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota
5
00:00:41,400 -----> 00:00:48,540
It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number three hundred thirty four and it is where the Lakota now live
6
00:00:48,570 -----> 00:01:10,870
Now if any of you have ever heard of AIM the American Indian Movement or of Russell Means or Leonard Peltier or of the standoff at Oglala then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota and that's a very difficult one for me
7
00:01:10,930 -----> 00:01:17,880
Because if you haven't noticed from my skin color I'm white and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation
8
00:01:17,920 -----> 00:01:24,090
You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today and I've become very close with them and they've welcomed me like family
9
00:01:24,930 -----> 00:01:29,490
They've called me brother and uncle and invited me again and again over five years
10
00:01:29,490 -----> 00:01:40,890
But on Pine Ridge I will always be what is called wasichu and wasichu is a Lakota word that means nonIndian but another version of this word
11
00:01:44,110 -----> 00:01:47,370
And that's what I want to focus on the one who takes the
12
00:01:49,110 -----> 00:01:49,990
It means greedy
13
00:01:51,350 -----> 00:01:53,030
So take a look around this auditorium today
14
00:01:54,210 -----> 00:01:59,230
We are at a private school in the American West sitting in red velvet chairs
15
00:02:01,990 -----> 00:02:05,410
And if we look at our lives we have indeed taken
16
00:02:07,680 -----> 00:02:18,030
So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain and know that when you see these people's faces that these are
17
00:02:25,680 -----> 00:02:29,820
On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my
18
00:02:32,850 -----> 00:02:37,090
The following is a timeline of treaties made treaties broken and massacres
19
00:02:40,000 -----> 00:02:41,280
I'll begin in twenty four
20
00:02:42,240 -----> 00:02:48,770
What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native
21
00:02:49,220 -----> 00:02:55,020
one thousand eight hundred fifty one The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made clearly marking the boundaries

are packed into rotting buildings with up to five

thirty nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity
99
00:11:21,900 -----> 00:11:25,760
At least sixty percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black
100
00:11:27,100 -----> 00:11:30,840
More than ninety percent of the population lives below the federal poverty
101
00:11:32,140 -----> 00:11:36,850
The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the US national
102
00:11:37,930 -----> 00:11:43,060
The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the US national

00:11:44,500 -----> 00:11:47,860
Cervical cancer is five times higher than the US national
104

School dropout rate is up to seventy
105

Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national
106
00:11:56,680 -----> 00:12:03,850
Frequently grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents due to alcoholism domestic violence and
107

fifty percent of the population over the age of forty suffers from
108
00:12:12,930 -----> 00:12:20,090
The life expectancy for men is between forty six and forty eight years old roughly the same

The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say My God
110
00:12:37,110 -----> 00:12:38,010
They're killing each other
111
00:12:38,800 -----> 00:12:41,450
They're killing themselves while we watch
112
00:12:43,560 -----> 00:12:46,190
This is how we came to own these United States
113
00:12:47,000 -----> 00:12:49,390
This is the legacy of manifest destiny
114
00:12:50,730 -----> 00:12:55,930
Prisoners are still born into prisonerofwar camps long after the
115
00:12:59,770 -----> 00:13:03,380
These are the bones left after the best meat has
116
00:13:07,240 -----> 00:13:15,070
A long time ago a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me by wasichu eager to take the land and the
117
00:13:18,550 -----> 00:13:21,410
Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end
118
00:13:22,710 -----> 00:13:34,880
As removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in one thousand eight hundred ninety or a series of broken treaties one hundred fifty years ago I still have
119
00:13:41,200 -----> 00:13:45,330
What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just
120
00:13:47,280 -----> 00:13:49,650
And how much of this history do you need to own even
121
00:13:50,840 -----> 00:13:52,070
Is any of this your responsibility today
122
00:13:54,570 -----> 00:13:56,720
I have been told that there must be something we can do
123
00:13:57,310 -----> 00:13:59,020
There must be some call to
124
00:14:01,050 -----> 00:14:06,460
Because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness just
125
00:14:08,990 -----> 00:14:14,080
Because the solution seems so far in the past I needed nothing short of a time machine to
126
00:14:16,010 -----> 00:14:19,590
The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a
127
00:14:21,960 -----> 00:14:27,280
It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti or ending AIDS or
128
00:14:29,040 -----> 00:14:41,010
The fix as it's called may be much more difficult for the dominant society than say a fifty dollars check or a church trip to paint some graffiticovered houses or a suburban family
129
00:14:44,660 -----> 00:14:45,610
So where does that leave us
130
00:14:46,580 -----> 00:14:48,030
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark
131
00:14:50,330 -----> 00:14:58,390
The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the one thousand eight hundred fifty one and one thousand eight hundred sixty eight Fort Laramie Treaties
132
00:15:00,070 -----> 00:15:04,250
The call to action I offer today my TED wish
133
00:15:08,540 -----> 00:15:09,840
Give back the Black Hills
134
00:15:10,640 -----> 00:15:12,340
It's not your business what they do with them
