employers who terminate employment contracts on the ground of poor performance have to substantiate your claim of poor performance
2
00:00:08,540 -----> 00:00:22,840
the tropicalized from fair employment practices makes it clear that employers who wish to terminate the services of employees on the ground of poor performance are to apply relevance and objective performance criteria
3
00:00:22,840 -----> 00:00:40,860
the criteria should be made known to all employees employers should also keep records of the employees performance and the decision to terminate the service of an employee to be based on documented poor performance the key word is documented
4
00:00:40,860 -----> 00:00:46,480
we involves a unionized employee the union should also be consulted
5
00:00:46,480 -----> 00:01:02,760
if the employee fast and appeal of unfair dismissal to m o m will first mediate should mediation fail will conduct an inquiry and require the employer to show costs and produce evidence to justify the termination
6
00:01:02,760 -----> 00:01:10,890
this remedy is provided under the employment act as well as the industrialization revision act for union members
7
00:01:10,890 -----> 00:01:23,890
if an employer is unable to substantiate his claim that the employees performances poor be employed maybe ordered to reinstate the employee or to provide compensation
8
00:01:23,890 -----> 00:01:41,580
if the employer does not comply with the order he can be prosecuted in the case of surbana jurong recent exercise to terminate the services of fifty four employees the company has acknowledge that the process could have been better managed
9
00:01:41,580 -----> 00:01:53,270
ah the management and unions have since reached an agreement on an extra gratia payment which in our view is a fair outcome for the affected employees
10
00:01:53,270 -----> 00:02:04,110
this episode serves as a good reminder to employers that termination exercises should be conducted in a responsible and sensitive manner
11
00:02:04,110 -----> 00:02:17,930
i would like to ask minister for this case of surbana jurong ah termination of the fifty four workers they are labelled poor performance with this label it is very difficult for them or additional challenges for them to find the next job
12
00:02:17,930 -----> 00:02:24,090
i would like to ask m o m if they need help is m o m going to help them to find their next job thank you
13
00:02:25,120 -----> 00:02:37,050
to have a mental speaker i i i share the concern of a a member of in fact a a i spend a many years and with the label movement and now with m o m
14
00:02:37,050 -----> 00:02:51,470
ah to the best of my recollection this is a first time is the first time that the employer conducts such a major termination exercise and to declare announce publicly to label at the workers is poor performance
15
00:02:51,470 -----> 00:02:58,540
i think is something that the as the as a manpower minister is something that the certainly i do not find it as acceptable
16
00:02:58,540 -----> 00:03:07,410
uh because uh when employers if the performance and employers are supposed so to speak
17
00:03:07,410 -----> 00:03:17,020
so in another words performerance management should be a joint responsibility of employees and employers here and in fact i think most organisation if
18
00:03:17,020 -----> 00:03:26,040
a the working relationship which reaches such a stage whereby the employees employers can no longer continue that kind of relationship i think they will find your way
19
00:03:26,040 -----> 00:03:44,930
find way to to to have to go separate way but you don't labe the person publicly there so so there's a reason why i think uh the i think the matter i think they realized as well that's why they also public acknowledge that the way they conduct exercises a i think a could be much better managed
20
00:03:44,930 -----> 00:03:47,710
uh but certainly i want to a hope through
21
00:03:47,740 -----> 00:03:50,460
ah make leader to oil enclose out there
22
00:03:50,460 -----> 00:03:58,610
that come to performance management i think do do it responsibly but at the same time do it sensitively
23
00:03:58,610 -----> 00:04:09,230
i hope i hope that will not come across another case with a company a do a major termination in labelled the the the employees is purpose
24
00:04:09,230 -----> 00:04:28,090
poor performers ya publicly year i think uh because at the end of the day yes in may be a poor performance among organization but it does not mean it does mean a person cannot do well in other places this is a mentioned work environment the h r practices and so on a they are also contributing factors
